Update by Zachary Friss
-------
I have extended this to show buses and predictions for trains.

I am working on a rewrite and continued development here:
[Server](https://github.com/Friss/BostonTransitServer)
[Website](https://github.com/Friss/BostonTransitWeb)


Simple real time tracking of Boston metros using Open Street Map (via OpenLayers) and MBTA's real time metro tracking.

See it live at [bostontraintrack.com](http://bostontraintrack.com).
